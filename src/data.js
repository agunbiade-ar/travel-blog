    description: `Named for the remnants of glaciers from the ice age, Glacier National Park is located on the border of Canada and Montana. It is often called the "Crown of the Continent," because of its dizzying array of natural beauty. A favorite spot among hikers, the park features a variety of trails for all skill levels, ranging from the easy Trail of the Cedars (home to towering and beautiful cedars) to the challenging Grinnell Glacier (which offers sweeping views). What's more, the park boasts more than 700 lakes, numerous waterfalls and two mountain ranges, spread across more than 1 million acres that shelter a variety of wildlife. 
   Aside from its breathtaking geological features, it's also home to a fair amount of history. The Going-to-the-Sun Road – a scenic, 50-mile drive through the park – is a National Historic Landmark and an engineering marvel that offers spectacular views, as well as access to popular hiking trails. Plus, many of the park's lodges, chalets and hotels were constructed by the Great Northern Railway in the early 20th century and are on the National Register of Historic Places. Care to visit a UNESCO World Heritage Site? You'll find that here, too: the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park`,

    description: `Snow-covered mountains, charming towns and flower-strewn meadows make the Swiss Alps a year-round fairy tale destination. Visit in the winter for world-class skiing (and après-ski fondue and drinks) in locales such as the exclusive St. Moritz and the picturesque Zermatt, home of the craggy Matterhorn. Opt for warmer months to hike through the verdant valleys of Swiss National Park or attend lively festivals in the foothill city of Montreux. Regardless of the time of year, no trip would be complete without a visit to the Jungfrau Region, where you can experience idyllic mountain villages like Grindelwald and Mürren or take the Jungfrau Railway to Europe's highest railway station`,

    description: `The island nation of the Maldives is popular with honeymooners looking for seclusion and adventurers looking to explore the depths of the sea on a scuba diving and snorkeling excursion. Travelers seeking relaxation can unwind at one of the island spas and all visitors should certainly spend a day exploring the Maldivian capital of Malé. The hotels in this region are also spectacular, ranging from underwater hotels to overwater bungalows to incredibly beautiful resorts. However, getting to and staying in this tropical paradise requires patience (there are no direct flights from the United States) and plentiful cash. Located between the Arabian and Laccadive seas, roughly 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka, the Maldives is about as isolated as you can get – and that's just another one of its many allures`,
